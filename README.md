During my internship, I successfully developed a background removal application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into harnessing the power of APIs, particularly while working with the background removal API. Moreover, I ambitiously attempted to replicate Adobe's sophisticated background removal website. This undertaking not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of web development and API integration.
